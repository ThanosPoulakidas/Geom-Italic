Geom, is a contemporary geometric sans serif typeface. It has 7 weights. This typeface is intended for display purposes but it works just as well in small texts. Even though the geometric typefaces look more dynamic in relation with other typefaces, Geom has gone one step further by having an even more additional dynamic characteristics on some of its characters. The typeface is a variable font which includes a Latin and Greek character set.

*  `make build` will produce font files.
